Why my UI and UX implementation and code implementation is the best?


This weather application system mainly focused on japan country, because of that I use the svg graphics to show how in my user experience where the place actually located. I use css framework bootstrap4 for the responsiveness and cross browsing compatibility of my system. The primary color comes from the Japan flag color.


In the back end I use the Laravel framework however for creating an API Request I use the vanilla Javascript. Using the ecma script coding standard it increase the system performance.
